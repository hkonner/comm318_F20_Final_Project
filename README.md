## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

### Inequality in Philadelphia

This project is created as a tool for philanthropic consulting. There is a lot of power held within this data and the analysis carried out that can be pushed forward and implemented to create change that will serve Philadelphia. All of this data is publicly available, but must be understood and applied for the type of systematic change we need to occur. In this project I will go through the steps of how to analyze, understand, use and apply this data to create positive change.

Philadelphia is a flourishing city, with drastic income, access, and public service inequalities. My initial concern was food deserts, and lack of access to healthy and affordable food for many Philadelphia residents and their families. Through my research I quickly realized food security was not the only obstacle many families were facing in terms of nourishing and keeping their families healthy. There are many external factors such as out of school recreational programs, public hydration stations, public exercise equipment, walkable access to healthy food, and public initiatives such as "Philly Rising" serving these challenged communities.

This data was collected from OpenDataPhilly and explored for the purposes of a communications class at the University of Pennsylvania called "Stories From Data".
