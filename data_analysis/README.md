## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

In my data analysis I began by counting, plotting, reading, and looking at the columns and rows of each data set to best decide how to break it apart and then build the data back together to tell the best data story possible. I chose to create an accessibility score that I could eventually compare all my other data against. In order to create a scale that I can generalize and measure all my data against I have decided to join two data sets and create a composite accessibility metric, then map those metrics. I will combine the Data from Neighborhood Food Retail and Walkable Access Healthy Food to form an accessibility score ranking locations from lowest to highest with multiple factors counting towards that score. I then overlay and analyze the geographical presence of public exercise equipment, acceptance of food bucks, Philly Rising boundaries, public hydration stations and out of school recreational programs. I then mapped over my accessiblity score to conclude a relationship. 

##### Accessibility Score
My Accessibility score was created, analyzed, and executed within the "initial_exploration_of_geojson_files" notebook. My hope for this score is that it can be a reference point for comparison and city planning. In the future I hope that people take this into account when initiating programs, stores, schools, homes, or restaurants within a community.

##### Factor Comparisons
My accessibility factor comaprisons are plotted, analyzed, and understood in my "farmers_market_locations_initial_exploration" notebook. In this plot, I overlay the Geo Data for the following Public Health services with the accessibility score that I created: public adult exercise equipment, acceptance of Philly food bucks, Philly Rising boundaries, public hydration stations and out of school recreational programs.


### Data analysis notebooks
My data analysis notebooks are titled as the following:

* exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb (The report, and the accompanying online resource gallery, looks at neighborhood availability of "high-produce supply stores” in relation to “low-produce supply stores” and explores the city blocks where there is low or no walkable access to healthy food and high poverty levels.)
* farmers_market_locations_initial_exploration.ipynb (this data set explores the locations of farmers markets around Philadelphia, but in doing that I was inspired to plot all of my data onto the same map and began comparing all of my data findings to each other, creating insight to the institutional inequality that Philadelphia is plagued by.)
* initial_exploration_of_geojson_files.ipynb (I am looking to explore how financial access to healthy food and walking distance to healthy food are related and impact each other. This notebook also contains my accessibility score)
* Initial_exploration_Out_of_School_Time_Programs.ipynb (This data explores out of school time programs. Out of School Time prorgams are important because they support working parents and caregivers, benefit a child’s academic, social, and personal development and helps children stay safe and avoid high-risk behaviors.)
* Initial_exploration_PhillyRising_Boundaries.geojson.ipynb (This data set explores and plots a program that offers services and aid to communities in need. By studying the locations of these efforts I am hoping to recognize areas that still need attention in comparison with those that are being serviced by this incredible program.)
* Initial_exploration_PPR_Hydration_Stations.geojson.ipynb (This data set explores locations of hydration stations and water fountains on or near Philadelphia Parks and Recreation (PPR) assets.)
* ppr_adult_exercise_equipment_initial_exploration.ipynb (This data set shows the locations of adult exercise equipment located within or maintained by Philadelphia Parks and Recreation (PPR). Public exercise equipment offers many benefits ranging from physical to social gains that improve overall health, internally and externally.)
