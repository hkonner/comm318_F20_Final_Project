## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

I collected geojson data from 8 different data sets that I found on Philly Open Data. My data sources are titled, "Farmer's Market Locations", "Walkable Access to Healthy Food", "Neighborhood Food Retail", "Parks and Recreation Out of School Time Programs", "Philly Rising Boundaries", "PPR Hydration Stations", "PPR Adult Exercise Equipment" and Farmer's Markets "Acceptance of PhillyFoodBucks",-- which will be plotted and analyzed below in tandem with the supporting data of "Philly Zip Codes Geo File". I began with counting, reading, plotting and understanding the data -- I then began a uniform collection of data onto a map of Philadelphia, comparing all of my data to the same visual map made which makes it easier for me and any audience to quickly and clearly see what the data patterns were and give ideas on how to mend these systems. I also supplemented my data with Philadelphia neighborhood, geography, and zip-code data.

#### Data Files

I began collecting CSV data, and quickly realized through suggestions from my peers and professors that GEO-data would be much more useful for the work I am aiming to do. I collected geojson data from 8 different data sets that I found on [Philly Open Data](https://www.opendataphilly.org/). 

My Data sources are titled:
* ["Farmer's Market Locations"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/farmers-markets-locations)
* ["Walkable Access to Healthy Food"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-food-access)
* ["Neighborhood Food Retail"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/neighborhood-food-retail)
* ["Parks and Recreation Out of School Time Programs"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/ppr-out-of-school-time-programs)
* ["Philly Rising Boundaries", "PPR Hydration Stations"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philly-rising-boundaries)
* ["PPR Adult Exercise Equipment"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/ppr-adult-exercise-equipment)
* ["Farmer's Markets "Acceptance of PhillyFoodBucks"](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/farmers-markets-locations)


These will be plotted and analyzed below in tandem with the supporting data. I began with counting, reading, plotting and understanding the data -- I then began a uniform collection of data onto a map of Philadelphia, comparing all of my data to the same visual map made which makes it easier for me and any audience to quickly and clearly see what the data patterns were and give ideas on how to mend these systems.
